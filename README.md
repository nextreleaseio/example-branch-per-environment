# Branch Per Environment Example #
## Overview ##
This strategy requires a minimum of a staging branch and a production branch. 
The staging branch acts as an area where all the upcoming changes in the next 
release are aggregated. Often times the changes loaded into staging are 
validated and shipped out to an environment mirroring production where the team 
can manually test fixes and new features prior to deploying them out to 
production.
